# go-warpwallet

This enables generation of a bitcoin address using the same technique as those found at https://keybase.io/warp/

This package currently calls out to pycoins `bu` commandline tool to do the final generation of the address. This will be fixed in a later version.

NB: I am quite new to golang, so please forgive any stupid mistakes
